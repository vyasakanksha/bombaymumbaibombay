From Bombay to Berlin and back to Bombay

Mumbai is a the city of dreams. A place where dreams are created, treasured, sometimes broken, and sometimes even fulfilled. It is a city where people from all over the country come to create a new life for themselves.

In a similar vein, Berlin is home to many immigrants, for many of whome this city holds tremendous historical significance. But it also promises a future - a chance to create a new life. 

The goal of this project is to create a collaborative digital space to map the emotions of everyone in both these cities - trasient or permanent. We will build a mobile app in flutter. The app will contain a map of the city and the ability to mark different locations with a emotion. Through the app, we will capture the single emotion that people are feeling at various locations in the city and slowly map out the emotional accociated with the entire city. 

Through this, we belive we will be able to find some trends (feeling romantic at Marine Drive) and some contradictions (pride / sorrow at the East Side Gallery). The goal of this project is to bind people together , and for us to know that we are not alone in these our journies. There are many people traveling the same streets with us, before us, and after us. 

This project was inspited by a Coding Culture Hackthon held by the GI
